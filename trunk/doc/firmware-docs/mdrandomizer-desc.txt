MDRandomizer

This is the upgraded version of the randomizer. It doesn't have any
new features yet, but a bug (the upper parameters on the third page
were not randomized) has been fixed.

New feature: configuration of sync and merging. Hold down Button1 (top
left) and then switch the MiniCommand ON. CLK selects the input port
(IN1 or IN2), SND activates sending out of the clock on the MIDI
Output, and MRG selects which messages on the second MIDI input will
be merged into the output stream (CC, NOTE or SYX
messages). MonoMachine Sysex messages won't be merged correctly (for
now).
