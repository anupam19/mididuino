#summary Help on building Mididuino

= Introduction =

Mididuino requires a big blob of binary data (containing java libraries and the avr-gcc toolchain for different OS) to be installed in order to build correctly. Download the file http://ruinwesen.com/support-files/mididuino-dist.tar.gz and unpack it in the directory containing your mididuino trunk/ folder).
